			 *
			 * Chunk Types (ID):
			 *  * HEADER (0x00):
			 *   - ROW-COUNT:     uint32_t --- The number of rows of the matrix
			 *   - COL-COUNT:     uint32_t --- The number of columns of the matrix
			 *   - STORAGE-ORDER: uint8_t  --- Zero if the matrix is stored in row major
			 *                                 non-zero if it is stored in column major
			 *  * ROWNAMES (0x01):
			 *   Contains ROW-COUNT zero terminated names.
			 *
			 *  * COLNAMES (0x02):
			 *   Contains COL-COUNT zero terminated names.
